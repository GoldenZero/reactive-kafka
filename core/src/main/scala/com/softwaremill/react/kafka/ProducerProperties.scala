   * brokerList
   * This is for bootstrapping and the producer will only use it for getting metadata (topics, partitions and replicas).
   * The socket connections for sending the actual data will be established based on the broker information returned in
   * the metadata. The format is host1:port1,host2:port2, and the list can be a subset of brokers or a VIP pointing to a
   * subset of brokers.
   *
   * topic
   * The high-level API hides the details of brokers from the consumer and allows consuming off the cluster of machines
   * without concern for the underlying topology. It also maintains the state of what has been consumed. The high-level API
   * also provides the ability to subscribe to topics that match a filter expression (i.e., either a whitelist or a blacklist
   * regular expression).  This topic is a whitelist only but can change with re-factoring below on the filterSpec
   *
   * clientId
   * The client id is a user-specified string sent in each request to help trace calls. It should logically identify
   * the application making the request.
